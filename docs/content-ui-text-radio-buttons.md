# Radio Buttons

Radio buttons allow a user to select 1 option from a list of 7 or fewer items. To learn more about
them, see [Radio](/components/inputs/radio).

Radio button groups include 2 types of labels:

- A [form field label](/content/ui-text/field-labels) that introduces the radio button group
- A radio label for each option in the group

**Radio Button Labels**

Like checkbox labels, radio button labels may be capitalized in 2 ways, depending on their length
and placement in the UI:

- Use title case for short labels
- Use sentence case for longer labels, or if the label reads like a phrase

We encourage the use of shorter, more concise labels whenever possible.
