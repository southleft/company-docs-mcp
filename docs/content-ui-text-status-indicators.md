# Status Indicators

Status indicators help the user quickly identify the status of a task, action, or page element. To learn more about them, see [Status Indicator](/components/indicators/status-indicator).

Status indicator labels should be direct and preferably 1 word long. Write status indicators in title case (first letter of each word capitalized, except prepositions and articles). Use words that are familiar to your user and relevant to the task. 

Keep status indicator labels shorter than 25 characters. Status indicators have a maximum width of 200 px (or about 25 characters), so if your label text is longer than that, it will be truncated with an ellipses, and the full label will only be visible in a tooltip when the user hovers over the status indicator. This is not an ideal user experience; avoid long labels whenever possible.
