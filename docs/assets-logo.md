# Logo and the Dub

Our Dub and logo are the core of our brand, and a defining piece of our story. It’s our most fundamental visual asset, which is why it’s vital to ensure it is used respectfully and effectively..

## Logo



We always lead with the Workday logo. However, in supporting materials or in places where the logo
has already set a precedent, we can use the Dub as a supplemental piece of brand expression. 

The Workday logo is a combination of our sunrise and our logotype. The logo is a standalone asset
that should in no way be distorted or redrawn when applied to communications. Carrying significant
equity, it is vital that it is always applied consistently.

For more information about the full Workday logo and a deeper look at brand guidelines beyond our
Canvas documentation, check out [this page](https://brand.workday.com/document/89#/-/logo) on the
Brand Central Style Guide.

## Usage Guidance

### Clear Space and Sizing



Our bespoke logo is custom-drawn to be the core that unites our design language. This diagram
highlights some of its unique features, and the consistent relationships between letterforms and
angles.

When using our logo, be sure to allow breathing room for maximum impact and legibility. It is
important to maintain a certain amount of space around the logo to prevent it from becoming
cluttered by surrounding artwork, images, messaging, or the edge of a composition. 

To maintain the integrity of our logo, we have defined minimum sizes. There are no predetermined
sizes. Scale and proportion are determined by available space, aesthetics, function, and visibility.

Digital minimum size: width of 102px



## The Dub



The “Workday Dub” is an extension of our logo when space is at a premium. It is used in our product
applications, as well as a favicon and an application icon, avatar, and additional way to represent
our company in promotional materials.

The Dub is constructed from the “w” within our full logo and paired with a reduced version of the
sunrise. Therefore, the spacing rationale is consistent with that of our logo.

### Digital Lockup

In digital applications where space is limited, it is often neccesary to use the “Workday Dub” in
the product header. Headers can be used with Canvas Kit or by following the specs below.
