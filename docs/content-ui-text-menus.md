# Menus

This entry covers the Menu and Select Canvas components. 

Menus are popups that display a list of up to 15 options when launched by an icon or button. To learn more about them, see [Menu](/components/popups/menu). See [buttons and calls to action](/guidelines/content/ui-text/buttons-and-calls-to-action) for guidelines on writing buttons to launch Menus.

Selects are inputs that allow users to choose 1 option from a list of items in a menu. Selects include a field label, placeholder text, container to house the menu, and a caret icon bundled around the menu. To learn more about them, see [Select](/components/inputs/select). See [Field Labels](/content/ui-text/field-labels) and [Placeholder Text](/content/ui-text/placeholder-text) for guidelines on writing other text elements that also appear in the Select component.

**Menu Items** 

Menu items appear in both the Menu and Select components. Use the following guidelines when writing menu item labels:

- Write menu item labels in title case (first letter of each word capitalized, except prepositions and articles).
- Sort the list of options in a consistent order (alphabetical, chronological, the most selected option, or by order of importance).
- Don’t include articles (a, an, the) in menu items.
