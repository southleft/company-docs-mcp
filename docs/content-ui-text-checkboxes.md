# Checkboxes

Checkboxes allow users to select 0, 1, or multiple values from a list of 7 or fewer options,
including a single option. To learn more, see [Checkbox](/components/inputs/checkbox).

Checkbox groups include 2 types of labels:

- A [form field labels](/content/ui-text/field-labels) that introduces the checkbox or checkbox
group
- A checkbox label for each option in the group

**Checkbox Labels**

- Keep all checkbox text concise.
- Don't use periods at the end of checkbox text.
- List options in a logical order, such as alphabetically or in order by most likely to be selected
first.

**Capitalization and Length of Labels**

Checkbox labels may be capitalized in 2 ways, depending on their length and placement in the UI:

- Use title case for short labels
- Use sentence case for longer labels, or if the label reads like a phrase

We encourage the use of shorter labels whenever possible.

**Note:** In the Workday Admin Guide, “check box” is spelled as 2 words. This Content Style Guide
deviates from the Workday Admin Guide and spells “checkbox” as 1 word in order to have parity and
consistency with our design and development partners. “Checkbox” is the standard spelling in code
and the spelling used for the Canvas design component “checkbox” that is referenced in this article
and throughout this Content Style Guide.

Avoid referring to checkboxes in the UI, just like you would avoid referring to any UI element or
component. In the unlikely event that you need to refer to a checkbox or checkboxes in the UI, spell
it as “check box” or “check boxes” to be consistent with Workday’s other documentation.
