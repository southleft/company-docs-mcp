# Link Text

Avoid using “click” or “click here.” Use actionable or descriptive text that best describes what the
link is.

Capitalization and punctuation of link text should be consistent. Use these guidelines:

- If the entire link is a sentence or sentence fragment, use sentence case for the text.
- If the link is embedded in other text (such as within a sentence), don’t capitalize the link.
- Don’t include closing punctuation unless the link is phrased as a question; in that case, close
with a question mark. If the text is a sentence fragment, don’t use punctuation.
