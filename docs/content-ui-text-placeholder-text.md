# Placeholder Text

Placeholder text is used in several Canvas components, including [Select](/components/inputs/select), [Text Area](/components/inputs/text-area), and [Text Input](/components/inputs/text-input). Placeholder text can serve 1 of 2 functions:

1. Give users instructions. For example, in a menu, placeholder text might say, “Select an option”.
2. Show users an example of what they can write in an empty text field. For example, in a Search text box, placeholder text might be “Search employees”.

**Note:** Placeholder text should be paired with form field labels; it is not a replacement for visible and accessible field labels.

Write this text in sentence case (first letter of the phrase capitalized, no period) and keep it as short as possible.

###### Do

- Select an option
- Search candidates

###### Don’t

- Select An Option
- Select the best option for your needs
- Search Candidates

When placeholder text is used in a text box next to a field label, make sure the field label text and the placeholder text are either both singular or both plural.

- Field label: Plan Type   

Placeholder text: Choose a plan type
- Field label: Plan Types   

Placeholder text: Choose plan types

###### Don’t

- Field label: Plan Type   

Placeholder text: Choose plan types
