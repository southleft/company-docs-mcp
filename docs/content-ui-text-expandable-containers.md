# Expandable Containers

Expandable containers hide and show information to create a focused experience for our users.
To learn more about them, see [Expandable Container](/components/containers/expandable-container).

**Expandable Container Titles**

Titles for expandable containers should be concise, but long enough to set clear expectations for the content that users will see when the container is expanded.

If you must use a longer title, make sure it doesn't exceed, or wrap, 2 lines of text (based on the size of the container).

Follow all other guidelines for [headings](/content/ui-text/headings).
