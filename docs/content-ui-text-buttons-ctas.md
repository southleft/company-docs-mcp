# Button Language Guidelines

Button labels (also known as Calls to Action or CTAs) should be as short and clear as possible, and
should describe the action the button performs. Follow these guidelines for button labels:

- Try to limit button labels to three words or less. Using one or two words, if possible, is ideal.
- Use title case (first letter of each word capitalized, except prepositions and articles).
- Remove most prepositions and articles (a, an, the).
- Do not use “click” or “press” as part of a button label.
- Use a noun after the verb if it adds clarity. Example: "Submit Expenses" instead of just "Submit."

###### Do

- Submit Expense Report
- Add Expense
- Open Messages
- Discard Changes

###### Don’t

- Submit your new expense report
- Add an Expense
- Click to Open Messages
- Discard (Discard what?)

**Buttons in Dialogs**

If a question is asked in a dialog, use button labels that match the question. Don't use OK/Cancel to answer yes or no questions.

###### Do

- Are you sure you want to delete this shift? Delete/Cancel

###### Don’t

- Are you sure you want to delete this shift? OK/Cancel
