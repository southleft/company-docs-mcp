# Dialogs, Popups, and Modals

Workday has several kinds of popup windows or notifications, including dialogs, modals, popups,
toasts, and more. Here are some general guidelines for the text contained within these elements:

- Phrase confirmations as yes or no questions.
- In the title of the dialog, be clear about what will happen if the user continues. (“Delete time
off request?”)
- Supplemental text should provide more information, not just reword the title.
- Tonally, your language should be approachable and clear. Try reading your message out loud, and if
it sounds unnatural to say, try rewriting.
- Use title case for dialog titles and buttons.
