# Pills

Pills are static or interactive elements that allow users to input, filter, or label information. To learn more about them, see [Pill](/components/indicators/pill).

Keep pill labels simple, concise, and shorter than 25 characters. Write pill labels in title case (first letter of each word capitalized, except prepositions and articles).

Pills have a maximum width of 200 px (or about 25 characters), so if your label text is longer than that, it will be truncated with an ellipses, and the full label will only be visible in a tooltip when the user hovers over the pill. This is not an ideal user experience; avoid long labels whenever possible.
