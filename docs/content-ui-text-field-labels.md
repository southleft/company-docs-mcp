# Field Labels

A field label is text that appears next to or above a field. It should give users information about
what the field contains. Keep field label text concise but still descriptive.

## Capitalization

Field labels may be capitalized in 2 ways, depending on their length and placement in the UI:

- Use title case for short labels that are to the left or above a check box.
- Use title case for labels that identify an object.
- Use sentence case for longer labels that are placed to the right of a check box, especially if the
label reads like a phrase.

We encourage the use of shorter, more concise labels whenever possible.

## Punctuation

- If the label is phrased as a question, use a question mark at the end.

## Prepositions

- Avoid using a preposition at the end of a field label.
- If you do use a preposition at the end of a field label, capitalize it.
