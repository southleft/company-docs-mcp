# Switches

A switch is a selection control used to toggle a function on or off. To learn more about them, see [Switch](/components/inputs/switch).

The label for a switch can be placed above or to the left of the switch (for right-to-left languages, labels are aligned to the right). 

Switches only have 2 options: on or off, enabled or disabled, and so on. However, the label remains static regardless of what state the switch is in. So, the label for a switch can either:

- Describe the on state of the switch
- Be neutral

Switch labels should be in title case and kept concise whenever possible.
